# Lessons

## Repository Structure
- `.workflows` repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows for standardization across Zondax projects
- Workflows include checks for TypeScript, Golang, Expo, Infrastructure, Docker publishing, and Pulumi
- Workflows are configurable through input parameters and can be called using `workflow_call` trigger 

## Container Security
- Container images should include both SBOM and provenance attestations
- SBOM should be in SPDX format and referenced via SHA256 hash
- Provenance should follow SLSA framework
- Use non-root users (65532:65532) for scratch images
